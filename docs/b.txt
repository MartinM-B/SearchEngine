The city of Salzburg has refused to renew a licence me for a silent disco after complaints that it was too loud and wild. At a silent disco people listen to music on wireless headphones, broadcast via a radio transmitter. If you don’t have headphones, it just looks like a room full of people dancing to no music. However the Mayor of Salzburg, Heinz Schaden, said it was still too loud for residents who like to sleep with their windows open in summer. They are upset about young people coming and going, late at night.  If the city refuses to renew the licence, the owner says he will organise a “silent demonstration”.
