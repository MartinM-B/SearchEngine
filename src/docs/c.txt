Traditionally, authors use words to create emotions in their readers. Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a new ‘wearable’ book to enhance this experience. It allows the reader to feel the protagonist’s emotions physically. Using a combination of sensors, the book triggers vibration patterns through a special vest. The vest also contains a personal heating device to change skin temperature and airbags, which tighten or loosen it. It’s the first ever book that can give the reader a virtual hug.
